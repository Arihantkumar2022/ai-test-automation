I need to generate test cases for a website called "{site_name}" ({site_url}).
I've extracted the following UI elements from the site:

{elements_summary}

Based on these elements, please generate 3-5 comprehensive test cases that would effectively test the key functionality of this website.

For each test case, provide:
1. A Test Case ID and brief description
2. Steps to execute (numbered)
3. Expected results

Format each test case as follows:

Test Case ID: TC001: [Brief Description]

Steps to Execute:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
...

Expected Result:
[Expected outcome]

Make sure each test case tests a specific functionality of the website such as navigation, form submission, search functionality, etc. Be specific with the steps and expected results.
